# TabZen Product Context

- Quick access to frequently used sites without typing URLs
- A central place to manage tasks and notes
- Visual motivation and personalization

### Current Solutions Fall Short
- **Default New Tab**: Too minimal, wastes valuable screen real estate
- **Existing Extensions**: Often bloated, slow, or require paid subscriptions
