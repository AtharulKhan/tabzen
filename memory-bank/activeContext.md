# TabZen Active Context

## Current Focus
Building the MVP version of TabZen Chrome extension with core widgets and functionality.

## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Chosen over frameworks to minimize load time and complexity
- **Modular Widgets**: Each widget is self-contained for easy maintenance
- **Local Storage First**: Privacy-focused approach, sync is optional
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, clean aesthetic with subtle animations

### Implementation Approach
1. Start with static MVP implementation
2. Add interactivity progressively
3. Optimize performance after functionality
4. Add advanced features based on user feedback

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create core file structure
2. Implement manifest.json with proper permissions
3. Build basic new tab HTML/CSS layout
4. Create widget framework
5. Implement first widget (Quick Links)

### Upcoming Features
- To-Do widget with local persistence
- Notes widget with auto-save
- Weather widget with geolocation
- Quotes widget with daily rotation
- Settings panel for customization

## Current Challenges

### Technical
- Ensuring sub-200ms load time
- Managing widget state efficiently
- Implementing smooth drag-and-drop
- Handling Chrome storage limits

### UX
- Balancing features with simplicity
- Making customization intuitive
- Providing good defaults
- Onboarding new users effectively

## Important Patterns

### Code Style
- ES6+ modules for organization
- Async/await for asynchronous operations
- Event delegation for performance
- CSS custom properties for theming

### Development Workflow
1. Implement feature in isolation
2. Test in development environment
3. Integrate with existing code
4. Update documentation
5. Test across different scenarios

## Learnings

### Performance
- DOM manipulation is expensive, batch updates
- Chrome Storage API is async, plan accordingly
- Service workers have limited lifetime
- CSS animations are more performant than JS

### User Experience
- Users want immediate value, not configuration
- Defaults matter more than customization options
- Visual feedback is crucial for interactions
- Consistency across widgets improves usability

## Project State
- **Phase**: Initial Development
- **Priority**: Core functionality over advanced features
- **Focus**: Getting MVP working end-to-end
- **Next Milestone**: Working extension with 5 core widgets
