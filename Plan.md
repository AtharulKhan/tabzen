## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Fabric.js v5.3.0**: Canvas manipulation library
- Loaded locally from `/src/libs/fabric.min.js`
- No additional external dependencies

### File Structure
```
/src
  /libs
    â””â”€â”€ fabric.min.js         # Fabric.js library
  /widgets
    â””â”€â”€ visionBoard.js        # Vision Board widget class
  /styles
    â””â”€â”€ visionBoard.css       # Vision Board styles
  /utils
    â””â”€â”€ storage.js            # Updated with Vision Board methods
  /newtab
    â””â”€â”€ newtab.html          # Added Vision Board button and modal
    â””â”€â”€ newtab.js            # Vision Board initialization
```

### Performance Considerations
- Fabric.js loaded only when Vision Board is opened
- Canvas size responsive to viewport
- Debounced auto-save (1 second delay)
- Image scaling to prevent oversized uploads
- Efficient storage using JSON serialization
